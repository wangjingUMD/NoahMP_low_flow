Noah-MP Community Repository

Model developers can make code development based on the develop branch and create pull request to the develop branch. The pull request will be reviewed by Noah-MP model release team and if everything looks good, the new code development will be merged to the official 'develop' branch. Eventually, the updates in develop branch will be merged to the master branch for official Noah-MP model release.
