# NoahMP_low_flow

This version of Noah-MP was modified based on Noah-MP v1.6 which is driven by High Resolution Land Data Assimilation System and can be executed in an off-line stand-alone mode for a 2-D gridded domain or a single point. One more runoff and groundwater scheme was added to the model.The new scheme called Groundwater for Ungauged Basin (GrUB). It is integrated into Noah-MP by substituting the underlying unconfined aqufier below the model 4-layer soil profile (~2 meters) in the TOPMODEL-based groundwater model SIMGM scheme.
